<h1>What is Fighter's Block?</h1>
Fighter's Block is a writing app that exploits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning">conditioning</a> to overcome writer's block and sheer laziness. Rewards for writing and punishments for stopping are wrapped in a battle system inspired by turn-based RPGs.<p>The opponent is a monster that deals continuous damage to the you, while you must keep writing to heal yourself and attack the monster. Hurry, before your HP drops to zero!
<p>Worry about editing later. For now, just get those creative juices flowing, and write. 
<h1>Cool! How do I use it?</h1>
To get started, enter your word count goal and click "Fight!" to continue.<br>

Now, defeat the monster by reaching your word count goal before your HP is reduced to zero.<br>

<h1>What do these buttons do?</h1>
This is the Pause button. When the game is paused, the monster will no longer deal damage to you. It's a good option to use if watching the HP bar slide down is hurting your mojo.<br><img src="whatis/4a.png"><br>

This is the Player button. Here, you can find options to see your stats and find a new monster.<br><img src="whatis/4b.png"><br>

This is the Settings menu. Here, you can change the attack speed and strength of your monster, to better suit your writing process. A faster monster deals damage more quickly, while a stronger one deals more damage in one blow.<br>
<img src="whatis/4c.png"><br>You can also make aesthetic changes to the text editor itself.<br><img src="whatis/5.png"><br>
Finally, this is the Minimize key.<br>
<img src="whatis/4d.png"><br>It hides the pixel images and shrinks the HP bar, for distraction-free writing.<br>

<h1>Sound interesting?</h1>

<h1>Some final notes</h1>
The word count function works in English (and other languages that use spaces to separate words) as well as Chinese.
